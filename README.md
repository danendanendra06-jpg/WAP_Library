WAP Library is a simple PHP-based web application created for academic purposes. The project demonstrates basic web development combined with introductory DevOps practices such as version control, workflow automation, and continuous integration using GitHub Actions.

Technology Used

This project uses Nginx as the web server, PHP as the main application language, MySQL as the database engine, Docker Desktop for environment setup, and GitHub Actions for automated checks and workflow management.

Project Overview

The application provides essential library functions and serves as a platform to learn collaboration workflows, branching strategies, and CI processes within a real project environment. Its structure is intentionally simple to support coursework requirements and DevOps experimentation.

Contribution Workflow

Development is done through feature branches. Changes are submitted through Pull Requests, and GitHub Actions automatically runs checks to ensure the project remains stable before merging into the main branch.
